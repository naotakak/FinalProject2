<h1>Europe Borders</h1>
<h4>Xavier Chen<br>Naotaka Kinoshita</h4>
This project shows the change of Europe's borders over time. Through scaling, rotation, and translation, maps are adjusted in a way that they are uniform to each other which allows for fluid transitions. Each country will be labeled.
